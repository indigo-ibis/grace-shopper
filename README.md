Team expectations
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on
Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take 10-15 minute break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
Take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
